    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>

    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

       <p>ax + b = 0  </p> 
      
     <p>here a and b are real numbers and x is a variable.<br>
     This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation.<br>
     Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form.<br>
     Also, the variable may or may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.</p>

    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

    <p>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</p>

    <p>where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).
         Also, a can't be 0. </p>
